# Gomez_et_al_2023
Repository for code used in Gomez et al. 2023: "Activity in developing prefrontal cortex is shaped by sleep and sensory input"

This repository contains the main scripts for determining firing rate by state, the proportion of responsive neurons within an area, and spindle burst detection. 
These codes are meant to be run on the database constructed for "Gomez et al. 2022", which will be hosted on Dryad.
